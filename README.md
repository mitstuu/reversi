# Reversi
This is one of my first ever projects, I will be practising with Python and Git to recreate one of my favourite games 'Reversi' or 'Othello', using VSCode and my WSL: Ubuntu distro workspace.

## Set-up
Reversi is played on an 8x8 board with black and white checkers. 
The initial position of the board is depicted by black and white checkers in the centre (rows 4 & 5, columns 4 & 5) of the board, with all other spaces left as blank.
